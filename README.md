# This repository includes R code necessary to develop 
## a) **Inventory Completeness** analysis
  Calculate well-survey cells based on species occurrence records using **knowBR** R package *Lobo, J.M., Hortal, J., Yela, J.L., Millán, A., Sánchez-Fernández, D., García-Roselló, E., … Guisande, C, (2018). KnowBR: An application to map the geographical variation of survey effort and identify well-surveyed areas from biodiversity databases. Ecological Indicators, 91: 241:248* [see here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X18302322)
  
   For the correct develop of this code, user needs to: 
  - Create a grid of the study area
  - Provide the occurrence records dataset of the taxa
  Output:
  - Estimators data including Ratio, Number of records, Slope and Completeness values
  
## b) **Environmental Space** analysis
  Calculate study area environmental space vs well-survey sampled space
